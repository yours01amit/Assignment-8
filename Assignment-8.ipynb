    "\n",
    "here are the defferences: \n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    "Abstraction refers to the process of reducing complex and detailed information to its essential features. It allows us to focus on the relevant aspects of an object and ignore the irrelevant details. In object-oriented programming, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. Abstract classes provide a template for creating concrete classes by defining a set of common behaviors or properties that subclasses must implement. Interfaces define a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface. Abstraction is useful for managing complexity, improving modularity, and promoting code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "Encapsulation refers to the practice of hiding the internal details of an object from the outside world, and providing a well-defined interface for interacting with the object. Encapsulation is achieved by using access modifiers such as public, private, and protected to control the visibility of the object's properties and methods. By hiding the implementation details of an object, encapsulation provides several benefits such as better security, modularity, and flexibility. Encapsulation also helps to prevent external code from modifying the internal state of an object directly, which can help to prevent bugs and other issues."

    "Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  The abc module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes\". It provides a way to define               abstract classes that can be used as a template for other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated, but serves as a blueprint for other classes to inherit from. It defines common methods and attributes that its subclasses must implement or override.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module provides the ABC class which is used as a base class for defining abstract classes. It also provides decorators like @abstractmethod and @abstractproperty that can be used to mark methods and properties as abstract.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the abc module can help ensure that the classes in your code conform to a particular interface or design pattern. It can also make your code more modular and easier to maintain, since changes to the abstract class can be propagated to its subclasses.\n",

    "Overall, the abc module is a useful tool for creating well-structured and maintainable Python code"

    "In Python, you can define an abstract class using the \"abstract base class\" module \"abc\". An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own, but instead serves as a template for creating subclasses. Abstract classes are used to define a common interface or behavior that is expected of all its subclasses.\n",

    "To create an abstract class in Python, you need to inherit from the ABC (Abstract Base Class) class and mark at least one method in the class as abstract using the \"@abstractmethod\" decorator. An abstract method is a method that has no implementation in the abstract class, but must be implemented in any concrete subclass that inherits from the abstract class."
